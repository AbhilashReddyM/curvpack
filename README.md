# CURVPACK

A set of routines to calculate curvature and Laplace-Beltrami operation on manifold triangular-element surface meshes. 

Includes a icosahedron based spherical surface mesh generator with quadratically increasing refinement (as opposed to exponential increase from subdivision methods). 

Six different curvature calculation algorithms and two different Laplace-Beltrami calculation algorithms are included. Examples 4 and 5 shows the rate of convergence convergence in curvature calculation. 

The figure shows the mean curvature (MC) and Gaussian curvature (GC) on a spherical surface surface perturbed by $Â Y^{2}_{5}$ spherical harmonic. See Example 1.
